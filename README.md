# DCES-Vibrotactile-Wristbands

## Rules

- Pushes directly to master are disallowed. For changes in the code please create a new branch, push your changes there and create a pull request so the other collaborators can review your work and merge it afterwards. This way we can avoid having a broken main branch and at least always have a working version.
- Reviewers please do not only look at the code but also checkout the branch and try out the changes.
- Try to include in your commit what changes you've made. So we can identify the commit later and revert it if needed. Avoid messages like: Fix, Fix 2, Fix 3 etc...
